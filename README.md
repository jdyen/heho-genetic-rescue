## Assessing offspring survival following genetic rescue


## Background

This repository contains code to recreate all analyses included in Pavlova et al. (submitted), Offspring survival in captive breeding trials supports the benefit of genetic rescue of a critically endangered subspecies from a divergent subspecies.

Supporting data are not currently included in this repository but will be made available on request.


## Usage

The `main.R` file loads all data, fits models, and creates all outputs included in the manuscript. This file uses several helper functions included in `R/utils.R`. The project environment is managed with the `renv` package, which records all packages and versions in the analysis. These packages can be installed locally with `renv::install()`; see the `renv` [website](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for details.
